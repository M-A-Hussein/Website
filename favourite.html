            <h1>My favourite Call of Duty Game</h1>
            <br><br>

            <p> I have played all the of Call of Duty games and I can say
                that Modern Warfare/WARZONE is unequivocally my favourite, from the mechanics of the game to the grapics its glorious!!!. bear in mind I'm not being sponsored by them but I wouldn't mind (LOL). HonestLy though its a great game.
            </p>

            </div>
            <br>

            <p>I would say my second favourite COD game would have to be
                vanguard because of its realism and immersiveness. I also like the old fashioned weapons from WW2.

                My favourite game modes are:
            </p>
                 Team Death match, the objective of this game mode is to eliminate the enemy to reach the score limit before the enemy team or whoever has the most points when the time runs out. The good thing about this game mode is that even one player can carry your team to victory if they are very good.  
                 
            </p>

            <br><br>
            
            <p> 
                Domination, the objective is to capture three flags dotted evenly throughout the map. Flag A, flag B, flag C.
                Once your team has captured a flag you and your team need to defend it from the enemy team until you reach the score or time limit. If a flag is captured there is no need to worry you can just win it back.
            </p>

            <br><br>

            <p>
            Headquarters, the objective for this game mode is to capture the headquarter before the enemy. once you have captured it you and your team must hold it for as long as possible you are no allowed to respawn once you have died until the headquarters has been taken by the enemy team, then the headquarters will change location and the process repeats itself until one team reaches the score limit or the time runs out.
            </p>
