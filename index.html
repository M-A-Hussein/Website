                <p>Hello and Welcome to my website where I
                    will be sharing my opinion based on my experiences in the game and I will also be posting gameplay, highlights that would please the eye of any self-respecting FPS gamer. Not to toot my own horn but toot toot, any gamer knows the satisfaction of playing well therefore this is going to be the dedicated space for posting and sharing my gameplay.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    I have spent many hours playing COD (Call of Duty) and have stored well over a thousand recordings of some of my best moments, obviously I'm not going to be posting all of them.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    What I like about COD is that there are so many factors which can affect gameplay, but I would say map knowledge is a biggie because if you know where the enemy is going to spawn or which path, they are most likely to take you can intercept them and take them out before they even know what's happening. Also understanding the weapon, you have, recognising its strengths and weakness with and without attachments can either enhance your gameplay or tarnish it. There are other factors, but I would need a few more pages to cover them all and nobody wants read when they could just watch someone explain it.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Big question, Controller or Keyboard and mouse? honestly, I would say that I'm equally skilled with both but, I prefer controller only because I grew up playing on consoles, I do change from time to time depending on how I feel.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    I'm sure people like to see smooth game play, which is what every gamer stives to achieve, including me LOL. Take a look through my website and I hope you like it.
